 * Read the following, and answer the questions by filling in the Strings in the code.
 
 Java doesn't make you deal with possible NullPointerException, or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in your code.
 If these exceptions happen, and are not caught, your program crashes.
 NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and several other exceptions, are called unchecked exceptions.
 
 It's possible to add try-catch blocks for NullPointerException, and other unchecked exceptions.
 You can also declare that a method throws NullPointerException, or any other unchecked exception
 
 But, Java insists that you deal with IOException â€“ which is a checked exception - in some way.
 The compiler checks that you have indeed done something about code that can throw IOException.
 You either have to surround your file IO code with a try-catch block, or declare that the method throws IOException.
 If your method throws IOException, then a method that calls this method also has to add a try-catch block, or declare that it also throws IOException.
 
 There are other checked exceptions, for example SQLException, which you'll see when we work with databases.
 
 Java's decision to implement two types of exceptions (checked and unchecked) is unusual.
 Other languages like C#, Python, JavaScript... have exceptions, but it's always up to you how to deal with them.
 You are never required to add try-catch blocks or declare that a method throws a particular exception;
 the responsibility is left to the programmer to implement whatever exception/error handling mechanism is appropriate.

 Questions:
 
 Considering many other languages don't require you to deal with exceptions,
 think about why Java does make you deal with at least some.
 
 1. List at least 1 benefit of checked exceptions
 2. List at least 2 negative consequences of checked exceptions
 3. What is your opinion on Java's decision to use checked exceptions?
 
 Usually, it's better to anticipate and try to prevent errors. Almost all unchecked exceptions can be
 prevented (in theory) by careful programming.  And many checked exceptions can also be prevented with careful coding.
 
 It's more common for programmers to try to prevent unchecked exceptions (e.g. NullPointerException)
 than to write a try-catch block for code that may throw that type of exception.
 
 4. For unchecked exceptions, why is it usually better to anticipate and avoid errors when possible,
 instead of using try-catch blocks? At least 2 reasons.
 
 Questions on this subject are common in Java job interviews!

/**
 *
 
 This program has two example methods. Both throw exceptions when you run the code.
 
 Fix by adding a try-catch block in each method.  Don't modify any of the existing code. Here, you will be adding new code.
 
 For the printLanguageList method, add try-catch statements.
 In the catch block, print a message that the LinkedList is empty. You don't need to do anything else, just let the method return.
 
 For the wordCount method, add try-catch statements so the NullPointerException thrown when the list is empty, is caught.
 In the catch block, return 0. So if the sentence is null, your method will return 0.
